        "(80 points) In this problem you are asked to write a Python program using Google Colab to construct a decision tree using the data from problem #4. Your program should use the measures of entropy and gain discussed in class to select features, should resolve ties randomly, and should label leaf nodes using majority vote. You may hard code the dataset or (more elegantly) design the program to read the data from a file. Finally, your program should be able to use the learned decision tree to output a label for the new data point introduced in problem #4.  *Note that all of the code you write needs to be entirely your own, not copied from another existing program or using existing libraries that perform the specified functionality.*"
